Project5: Boolean Logic

Function that creates circuit A: circuit_a()
Function that creates circuit B: circuit_b()
Function that creates circuit C: circuit_c()

Function that generally tests any circuit for all inputs: circuit_tester(Circuit circuit)

I handled NAND and NOR gates by implementing them in the Gates.c file. You can look at it for my implementation.
To run:
type "make"
should compile with no errors.
type "./boosim"
You will get dumps of each circuit, along with all possible combinations and their logical evaluation.

Extra Credit(10% one):

Function that creates bitAdder circut: circuit_bitadder();

Will show up last in the printout, under Testing EXTRA CREDIT circuit BitAdder:
You will get a dump and and all the possible combinations.
